It was the first human-made object to reach outer space, attaining an apogee of 176 kilometers,[21] which is well above the Kármán line.[22] It was a vertical test launch. Although the rocket reached space, it did not reach orbital velocity, and therefore returned to Earth in an impact, becoming the first sub-orbital spaceflight.[23] In 1949, the Bumper-WAC reached an altitude of 393 kilometres (244 mi), becoming the first human-made object to enter space, according to NASA.[24]</li>
